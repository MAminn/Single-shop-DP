/**
 * NoirReferenceTopFrame — the Noir landing's top composition, rebuilt as a
 * dedicated pixel-matched clone of the design reference.
 *
 * This replaces NoirTopExperience wholesale. It shares no geometry with the
 * generic Noir section/card system: the navbar row, hero panel, best-sellers
 * row and product card are all NoirReference* components that exist only for
 * this frame, so matching the reference cannot regress the Noir shop, product
 * or sorting pages — let alone the other four demos.
 *
 * ── How the geometry is encoded ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every measurement was read off the reference screenshot at a 1344px
 * viewport, where the frame is 1312px wide (16px page gutter each side).
 * Hardcoding those pixels would only be right at 1344px, so the frame instead
 * publishes a CSS length `--nu` equal to ONE reference pixel:
 *
 *     --nu: calc(100cqw / 1312)
 *
 * `100cqw` resolves against the measuring wrapper — whose width IS the frame
 * width — so `--nu` is exactly 1px at the reference viewport and scales
 * linearly elsewhere. Descendants call `nu(54)` and land on the reference
 * pixel at 1344px while holding the reference ratio at every other width.
 * Heights are always `min-height`, so longer CMS copy grows a box instead of
 * being clipped.
 *
 * ── Frame stack (bottom to top) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   L0  base floor          #0a0a0a
 *   L1  atmosphere          the CMS hero artwork, LIGHTLY softened, spanning
 *                           the whole frame — the warm continuation visible
 *                           behind the cards in the reference is literally
 *                           the same picture as the sharp hero artwork
 *   L2  scrim               shapes how much atmosphere reads at each band:
 *                           dark under the navbar, open across the hero,
 *                           part-open behind the cards, closed at the base
 *   L3  content             navbar -> hero panel -> glass shelf + cards
 *
 * The heavy blur belongs to the SHELF's backdrop-filter, not to L1. Blurring
 * the source layer produces a haze that merely sits in front of the frame;
 * blurring the backdrop produces glass, because the softening is derived from
 * the live picture at the moment it is composited. That distinction is the
 * whole difference between the reference's lower band and a fog overlay.
 *
 * All content is CMS/props-driven; this component contributes only chrome.

            {/* GLASS SHELF — the lower band sits on a translucent blurred
                surface so the shared atmosphere reads THROUGH glass: the
                backdrop blur softens the already-blurred artwork further, the
                near-black fill cools the band without flattening it, and the
                top hairline is the sheen where the glass edge catches light.

                blur + saturate on the BACKDROP is the frosted-glass recipe:
                the blur samples the live picture behind the shelf, and the
                saturate puts back the chroma that averaging pixels together
                takes out. Without that saturate a backdrop blur always drifts
                toward grey, which is half of why the band looked muddy — the
                warm brown/red was being averaged into neutral.

                The fill is only 22% now, not 45%. It exists to seat the glass,
                not to tint the band; at 45% it was doing the job the scrim
                should do and killing the picture with it. Ordering matters:
                the fill sits ON the blurred backdrop, so every point of alpha
                here costs picture transmission directly.

                The shelf contributes NO box metrics — no padding, margin or
                border-width — so the row's reference geometry (gutter, gap,
                bottom flush) stays owned entirely by the row itself. */}
